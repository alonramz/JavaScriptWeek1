// EASY: Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each.
// Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer,
// and by how many characters.
// Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”

let personName = "Alondra";

let personName2 = "Steven";

console.log(
  `The name ${personName} is longer than ${personName2} by 2 characters`
);
